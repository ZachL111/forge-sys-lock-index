# forge-sys-lock-index

`forge-sys-lock-index` packages a practical systems programming exercise in R. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Forge Sys Lock Index

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Repository Map

- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Main Behaviors

- Includes extended examples for bounds checks, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents low-level invariants tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Internal Model

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying systems programming behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The R version keeps the model as simple functions over named lists for easy analysis use.

## Run It Locally

Use a normal shell with R available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Scenario Walkthrough

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more systems programming fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Known Edges

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.
